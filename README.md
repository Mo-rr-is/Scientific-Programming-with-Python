- Functions and Branching.
- User Input and Error Handling.
- Arrays and Plotting.
- Dictionaries and Strings.
- Classes.
- Random Numbers and Simple Games.
- Object-Oriented Programming.

## Random Numbers ans Simple Games
The key idea in computer simulations with random numbers is first to formulate an algorithmic description of the phenomenon you want to study.
### Drawing Random Numbers
Function call *random.random()* generates a random number in the half open interval [0,1).$\newline$
For debugging purposes, it is useful to get the same sequence of random numbers every time we run the program. This is obtained by setting a **seed** before we start generating numbers.
$\newline$
The numbers generated by *random.random()* tend to be **equally distributed** between 0 and 1. We say that the distribution of the random numbers in this case is **uniform**.
